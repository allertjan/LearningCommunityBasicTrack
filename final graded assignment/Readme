To start the program the user needs the files: "assignment final", "CSV_history" and the "info_about_debtors".
In order to run the whole program the user needs to run the "assignment final" file.
This file will ask for the company name. If the address of the company name is known then it will get the info from
"info_about_debtors" file. Else the user will asked to fill in the information. This information will be added to the
"info_about_debtors" file. The user will then be asked to fill in various info about the products.
With this information final numbers will be calculated. After that, the invoice number will be calculated by getting last
invoice number from the "CSV_history" file. Then the program has all the info it needs in order to add info to the
CSV and make an invoice. The name of the invoice will always be the company's name plus the invoice number.


I would like to continue with the advanced track of the Learning Community. Thank you for all the enjoyable classes.
